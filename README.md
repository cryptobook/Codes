# Code-based Cryptography
## Goppa codes
Goppa codes can be used for cryptographic purposes. We give a toy example of a [16,8,5] Goppa code and Patterson's decoding algorithm in SageMath.


We include several examples using this Goppa code:


- Decoding example with Patterson's algorithm
- Encryption and decryption with the McEliece cryptosystem
- Information-set decoding
- Encryption and decryption with the Niederreiter cryptosystem
